## Overview 📖

Groupie Trackers is a project that involves creating a website to display information about bands and artists based on a given API. The API consists of four parts:

1. **Artists**: Contains information about bands and artists, including names, images, years of activity, first album dates, and members.
2. **Locations**: Lists the locations of their last or upcoming concerts.
3. **Dates**: Lists the dates of their last or upcoming concerts.
4. **Relation**: Links artists, dates, and locations.

The goal is to present this data through various visualizations and to implement a client-server feature that responds to user actions.
